# Node.js Worker Threads Example

This project demonstrates how to offload CPU-intensive tasks to a worker thread in Node.js, improving the responsiveness of your main application thread.

## How It Works

- The main thread delegates a CPU-intensive task (e.g., calculating a large Fibonacci number) to a worker thread.
- The worker thread performs the computation without blocking the main thread.
- Results are sent back to the main thread once the computation is complete.

## Usage

1. Run the example:

  ```
  node main.js
  ```

You should see output indicating that the main thread remains responsive while the worker thread processes the task.

## Files

- `main.js` - Starts the main thread and offloads work to the worker.
- `worker.js` - Contains the CPU-intensive task logic.

## Requirements

- Node.js v12.0.0 or higher (for worker threads support)
